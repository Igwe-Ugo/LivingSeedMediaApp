    "aboutBook":"BECOMING LIKE JESUS is a short treatise on DISCIPLESHIP. It mirrors several years of carefully built convictions of God's ultimate goal for mankind\n\nThe road to genuine and abundant living must wind through GOLGOTHA with an ever increasing conformity with the man of CALVARY. JESUS CHRIST, the Lord. Satan and the contemporary world would have backmailed this way and made it very unpopular. Many sincere Christians have been subtly diverted to seek victory and fulfillment through several shortcuts; sometimes with seeming 'breakthroughs'.\n\nThere is neither true prosperity nor abundant life for any man who is till under the rule of the natural SELFLIFE! God's unequivocal condition to man is:\n'...let him deny himself; and take up his cross and follow Me.'",
    "whoseAbout":"Christians who really want to become like Jesus and get this key to abundant living. It is God's way to entering heaven.",

    "aboutBook":"It is important for you as a man to personally discover why you were born a male and what it will take to be the man you were born to be for your own generation. To be the real husband and to be a father indeed in God's eternal plan is a critical role that many men have little or no idea about... The dimension of glory that God longs to see manifest in our generation is supposed to flow from the Shekinah glory of God Himself. Man is the basic link for that flow on earth.\nThis book is a straight talk to the man in you. You may find several principles in it obscure, be patient to study them. Tips on effective fathering are issues you dare not brush aside. May it call you forth to accomplish the purpose of God for which you were born a male.",
